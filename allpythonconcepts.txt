learning of python: 

we cannot directly interact with hardware so, we take help of operating system.
so, we need to interact with os thats it os will do all tasks and actions with hardware.
here for interacting with os we use a language called python, here python can interact with operating syatem
and execute the tasks.

when a file is in harddisk that is a program and when the file is loading on to memory[RAM] with the help of
os then the program file will acts like command or also called as process while executing.






python can be used in 3 ways:
1.live interpretor [cmd--> (type) python] after installing.[code will not be saved].
2.write a python file and run from cmd as -> python filename.py
3.IDE[were we have a environment to develop and many things are integrated].[cmd-->jupyter notebook]


1.function used behind x[0] in python  >>> x.__getitem__(0)

2.dir() is used to see packages or modules from python live interpretor
 even we can specify a single module like dir(__builtins__) for functions inside them[dir(os)]. 
 want to know details of inside of a function use help(print).


3.if you want to see all modules installed use --->pip list

4. A module is a single python file having multiple functions in it and can even have classes in it.

5.live interpretor symbol >>> [REPL ->Read Evaluate Print and Loop]


6.import os
  os.system("chrome")  -->system function opens chrome which is in os module (if not opens set environmental path of app)


7.type(varaible) used to check what type of variable it is.


8.x[start:end:jump] can use for string or list
jump will be used for jumping number of terms by default it is one[1]. 


9. we dont have switch and increment opertors in python

10.we can include else block for while loop also




////creating cgi (common gate way interface)------used in redhatsystem
we can connect to other system or server by using cgi
->when we only want to view then use /var/www/html/(filename)
->when want to execute a program file and send that information to client then:

step1: place program file in the folder  /var/www/cgi-bin/

step2:make that program file executable an place in that folder for that
use chmod +x filename

step3: write or use hashbang or shebang(#!) at first line of program file
#!path of python3 software(/usr/bin/python3)

step4:
normally we can execute file by using  ./filename now in terminal.

step5:write a line as print("content-type:text/html")

step6:now try to ping in browser by ip address/cgi-bin/programfile

now it we run on server and send to client
